    quote: AirBeam is affordable, accurate, and easy to transport. It gives many ways to interpret data and students love that they get to use scientific technology and can make sense of what it's saying. It gives a real sense of immediacy and relevancy of science to students who might otherwise struggle with science in the classroom.
