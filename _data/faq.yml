      AirBeam2 is “quite accurate” according to the <a
      href="http://www.takingspace.org/airbeam2-quite-accurate-according-to-newly-released-performance-evaluation/"
      target="_blank">performance evaluation</a> conducted by South Coast Air
      Quality Management District’s AQ-SPEC lab. Another AirBeam2 <a
      href="http://www.takingspace.org/airbeam2-technical-specifications-operation-performance/"
      target="_blank">performance evaluation</a>, conducted by researchers at
      NYU School of Medicine, also found that the PM2.5 measurements from the
      AirBeam2 closely matched those from a collocated reference instrument.

    question: 'How accurate is the AirBeam2?  '
  - answer: >-
      Yes, the AirBeam2 is designed to go wherever you go, unless you’re going
      underwater : ) When cycling or driving, face the AirBeam2 intake and
      exhaust ports (the perforations located between the wavy edges) away from
      your direction of travel to minimize wind interference.

    question: Is the AirBeam2 suitable for outdoor installations?
  - answer: >-
      Yes, the AirBeam2 is designed to go wherever you go, unless you’re going
      underwater : ) When cycling or driving, face the AirBeam2 intake and
      exhaust ports (the perforations located between the wavy edges) away from
      your direction of travel to minimize wind interference.

    question: >-
      Can I walk/bike/drive with the AirBeam2 and measure my personal exposure
      to air pollution?
  - answer: >-
      Buy two AirBeam2s, configure them both to record fixed sessions, and place
      one inside and the other outside. Keep tabs on the particulate matter
      measurements in real-time using the AirCasting app or website. When the
      air quality is better outside than inside, open your windows. When the air
      quality is better inside than outside, keep your windows closed.

      What’s the best way to monitor the air quality in my home/workplace/school
      to determine when I should keep the windows closed or open them up to
      improve the air quality?
  - answer: >-
      Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter or PM2.5 has been linked to
      a range of health problems including asthma and respiratory inflammation,
      lung cancer, heart attack, and stroke. The U.S. Environmental Protection
      Agency establishes the <a
      href=https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants/naaqs-table”
      target=”_blank”>National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)</a> and <a
      href=https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=aqibasics.aqi” target”_blank”>Air
      Quality Index (AQI)</a> on the best science available, which typically
      uses averaging time periods of 24 hours or longer when examining PM2.5
      data and relating it to health outcomes. The AirCasting app and website
      uses the NAAQS standards for PM2.5 exposure and the AQI to relate colors
      to measurements: 0-12 ug/m3 is green, 13-35 ug/m3 is yellow, 36-55 ug/m3
      is orange, and 55-150 ug/m3 is red. (The relationship between colors and
      measurements can be changed inside the AirCasting app and website.) These
      ranges/colors roughly correspond to increased health risks as the
      concentration of PM2.5 in the environment rises. However, there are some
      big caveats that should be noted. First, data shows that<a
      href=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)62158-3/fulltext”
      target=”_blank”>health effects occur at levels well below current
      regulatory thresholds</a>, especially for the most toxic aerosols, like
      those from <a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-35398-0“
      target=”_blank”>diesel exhaust</a>. Second, as mentioned, most health
      studies have primarily examined long-term exposures to air pollution, not
      short-term exposures, leaving the potential health implications of such
      exposures unclear. Current health studies are only just beginning to
      establish the relationships between short-term exposures to fine and
      ultra-fine particles and health effects, including blood inflammation and
      increased likelihood of heart attack. Third, because the AirBeam2 does not
      meet the US government’s performance or quality assurance requirements
      (there are no Federal Equivalency Method or Federal Reference Method
      low-cost, mobile instruments for measuring PM2.5 on the market) this
      introduces uncertainty in the interpretation of the AirBeam2’s particle
      measurements.
