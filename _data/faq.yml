      Can I walk/bike/drive with the AirBeam2 and measure my personal exposure to
      air pollution?
    answer: >-
      Yes, the AirBeam2 is designed to go wherever you go, unless you’re going
      underwater.  When cycling or driving, face the AirBeam2 intake and exhaust
      ports (the performations located between the wavy edges) away from your
      direction of travel to minimize wind interference.

  - question: >-
      What’s the best way to monitor the air quality in my home/workplace/school to
      determine when I should keep the windows closed or open them up to improve the
      air quality?
    answer: >-
      Buy two AirBeam2s, configure them both to record fixed sessions, and place one
      inside and the other outside.  Keep tabs on the particulate matter
      measurements in real-time using the AirCasting app or website.  When the air
      quality is better outside than inside, open your windows.  When the air
      quality is better inside than outside, keep your windows closed.
