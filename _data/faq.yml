      AirBeam2 is “quite accurate” according to the <a
      href="http://www.takingspace.org/airbeam2-quite-accurate-according-to-newly-released-performance-evaluation/"
      target="_blank">performance evaluation</a> conducted by South Coast Air
      Quality Management District’s AQ-SPEC lab. Another AirBeam2 <a
      href="http://www.takingspace.org/airbeam2-technical-specifications-operation-performance/"
      target="_blank">performance evaluation</a>, conducted by researchers at
      NYU School of Medicine, also found that the PM2.5 measurements from the
      AirBeam2 closely matched those from a collocated reference instrument.

    question: 'How accurate is the AirBeam2?  '
  - answer: >-
      Yes, the AirBeam2 is designed to go wherever you go, unless you’re going
      underwater : ) When cycling or driving, face the AirBeam2 intake and
      exhaust ports (the perforations located between the wavy edges) away from
      your direction of travel to minimize wind interference.

    question: >-
      Can I walk/bike/drive with the AirBeam2 and measure my personal exposure
      to air pollution?
  - answer: >-
      Buy two AirBeam2s, configure them both to record fixed sessions, and place
      one inside and the other outside. Keep tabs on the particulate matter
      measurements in real-time using the AirCasting app or website. When the
      air quality is better outside than inside, open your windows. When the air
      quality is better inside than outside, keep your windows closed.

    question: >-
      What’s the best way to monitor the air quality in my home/workplace/school
      to determine when I should keep the windows closed or open them up to
      improve the air quality?
  - answer: >-
      Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter or PM2.5 has been linked to
      a range of health problems including asthma and respiratory inflammation,
      lung cancer, heart attack, and stroke. The U.S. Environmental Protection
      Agency establishes the <a
      href="https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants/naaqs-table"
      target="_blank">National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)</a> and <a
      href="https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=aqibasics.aqi"
      target="_blank">Air Quality Index (AQI)</a> on the best science available,
      which typically uses averaging time periods of 24 hours or longer when
      examining PM2.5 data and relating it to health outcomes. The AirCasting
      app and website uses the NAAQS standards for PM2.5 exposure and the AQI to
      relate colors to measurements: 0-12 ug/m3 is green, 13-35 ug/m3 is yellow,
      36-55 ug/m3 is orange, and 55-150 ug/m3 is red. (The relationship between
      colors and measurements can be changed inside the AirCasting app and
      website.) These ranges/colors roughly correspond to increased health risks
      as the concentration of PM2.5 in the environment rises. However, there are
      some big caveats that should be noted. First, data shows that<a
      href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)62158-3/fulltext"
      target="_blank"> health effects occur at levels well below current
      regulatory thresholds</a>, especially for the most toxic aerosols, like
      those from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-35398-0"
      target="_blank">diesel exhaust</a>. Second, as mentioned, most health
      studies have primarily examined long-term exposures to air pollution, not
      short-term exposures, leaving the potential health implications of such
      exposures unclear. Current health studies are only just beginning to
      establish the relationships between short-term exposures to fine and
      ultra-fine particles and health effects, including blood inflammation and
      increased likelihood of heart attack. Third, because the AirBeam2 does not
      meet the US government’s performance or quality assurance requirements
      (there are no Federal Equivalency Method or Federal Reference Method
      low-cost, mobile instruments for measuring PM2.5 on the market) this
      introduces uncertainty in the interpretation of the AirBeam2’s particle
      measurements.

    question: What level of fine particulate matter exposure is considered dangerous?
  - answer: WHAT?
    category: GETTING STARTED WITH AIRBEAM2
    question: What do I need to get started with the AirBeam2?
  - answer: >-
      The AirBeam2 has two LEDs. One serves as the battery-charging indicator
      and the other serves as the connection indicator. The battery-charging
      indicator is located closest to the USB charging port. When it’s green,
      the battery is charging and when it turns off the battery is fully
      charged. The connection indicator is located closest to the power button.
      Red indicates the AirBeam2 is getting set-up, green indicates that it’s
      ready to be configured, blue indicates it’s getting the time (this is only
      for fixed sessions), white indicates it’s sending data, and blinking red
      indicates the AirBeam2 is disconnected from the Android device (this is
      only for mobile sessions). Note that after glowing white for two minutes
      to indicate that the AirBeam2 is successfully sending data, the connection
      indicator will turn off to conserve battery power. Also note that the
      AirBeam2 has a configuration window of 50 seconds after which the AirBeam2
      will default to its previously selected configuration.

    question: What do colored LEDs on the AirBeam2 mean?
  - answer: >-
      If you plan on moving around with the AirBeam2 while recording air quality
      measurements, configure the AirBeam2 to record a mobile session. When
      recording a mobile AirCasting session, measurements are created,
      timestamped, and geolocated once per second. If you plan to leave the
      AirBeam2 indoors or hang it outside then configure it to record a fixed
      session. When recording fixed AirCasting sessions, measurements are
      created and timestamped once per minute and geocoordinates are fixed to a
      set location. Fixed-WiFi sessions send data to the AirCasting website via
      the 2.4 GHz band of your wireless router. Fixed-cellular sessions send
      data to the AirCasting website via the 2G cellular network. There are
      three primary differences between fixed and mobile sessions: 1) The
      averaging time interval for mobile sessions is one-second, whereas the
      averaging time interval for fixed sessions is one-minute; 2)
      geocoordinates are updated every second when recording a mobile session,
      whereas geocoordinates are never updated when recording a fixed session;
      and 3) measurements are communicated to the AirCasting Android app via
      Bluetooth when recording a mobile session, whereas measurements are
      communicated directly to the AirCasting website via either the WiFi
      network or cellular network when recording a fixed session.
    category: GETTING STARTED WITH AIRBEAM2
    question: >-
      I can configure the AirBeam2 to record a mobile or fixed session; what’s
      the difference and how do I know which recording mode best fits my needs?
  - answer: >-
      If you want to record a mobile session and you’re device is not already
      connected to the AirCasting app, you’ll need to connect it. You’ll know
      your AirBeam2 is connected to your Android device when you see five grey
      circles stacked on top of one another inside the AirCasting app Dashboard.
      Press the record button in the upper right hand corner to begin recording
      a mobile AirCasting session. Once you configure an AirBeam2 to record a
      fixed session, it will send data to the AirCasting website every minute
      until you turn it off. When recording a fixed session, the measurements
      are communicated once a minute to the AirCasting website via your wireless
      router or the cellular network. Your Android device no longer needs to be
      in proximity to the AirBeam2 as it’s retrieving the data from the web via
      the Android device’s WiFi or cellular connection.
    category: GETTING STARTED WITH AIRBEAM2
    question: >-
      Once I setup my AirBeam2 and connect it to the AirCasting app, is it
      constantly recording measurements or do I need to configure it each time I
      want to use it?
  - answer: >-
      All wireless routers have a 2.4 GHz band, however, you’re wireless
      router’s 2.4 GHz band might not be setup. Many newer routers are dual
      band, offering both 2.4 GHz and 5GHz bands.  If you have a dual band
      router, make sure the 2.4 GHz band is setup and the AirBeam2 is accessing
      that band when configuring the AirBeam2 to record a fixed-WiFi session.

    question: >-
      I want to record a fixed-WiFi session; how can I figure out whether my
      WIFI network is 2.4 GHz?
  - answer: >-
      Many low cost carriers, like Ting, offer cheap SIM cards and low-cost
      month-to-month cellular service. Check with your cellular provider to find
      out if they offer 2G service. If they do offer 2G service, check their
      coverage maps to see if they offer 2G service in your location.

    question: >-
      I want to record a fixed-cellular session; how can I figure out whether
      the SIM card I inserted into the AirBeam2 has access to the 2G network. 
  - answer: >-
      If you haven’t reconfigured your AirBeam2 then simply turn it on and it
      will load the last selected configuration and continue streaming under the
      same session title. If you subsequently reconfigured the AirBeam2,
      navigate to the Sessions screen, tap the title of the fixed session you
      want to continue, tap “Continue Streaming”, and navigate through the
      configuration decision tree.
    category: GETTING STARTED WITH AIRBEAM2
    question: >-
      I previously configured my AirBeam2 to record a fixed session; how do I
      continue streaming (adding measurements) to that same fixed session?
  - answer: >-
      The AirCasting app can record the AirBeam measurements and sync your
      session data over WiFi without need for a cellular data plan. The only
      thing that won't work is that the map tiles inside the app won't load when
      you’re away from WiFi and without a data plan. You don't have to do
      anything special; just use the app as you normally would. The only
      challenge to not having the map tiles is that it's difficult to confirm
      that you have an accurate GPS fix. Here is what we suggest, since you
      won't have cellular service. 1) When you have access to WiFi confirm that
      your location is accurate on the map. If it's not accurate get outside if
      you can, if that's not possible, then place your phone near a window. 2)
      Once you've confirmed your location is accurate, zoom in on the map until
      the screen shows only your immediate blocks. 3) Once you've stepped
      outside and started recording, make sure the colored dots displayed on the
      screen create a trail. If the dots are being layed down directly on top of
      one another you don't have a proper GPS fix as it's not registering your
      movement.

    question: >-
      Can I collect data using an Android device without a cellular data
      connection?
  - answer: >-
      Once you configure an AirBeam2 to record a fixed session, it will send
      data to the AirCasting website every minute until you turn it off.  You
      don't need to do anything if the WiFi connection is dropped. Simply
      restore the WiFi signal and the data will continue streaming.
    category: GETTING STARTED WITH AIRBEAM2
    question: >-
      The WiFi network that my AirBeam2 was connected to went down temporarily. 
      Now that the WiFi network is up again, do I need to do anything to get my
      AirBeam2 streaming again?
  - answer: >-
      Your Android device needs to come equipped with Bluetooth and GPS and have
      access to the Google Play store. (Certain Android devices, like those made
      by Amazon, do not have access to the Google Play store.) In addition, it’s
      best to use an Android device with 2GB of RAM or more. Mobile AirBeam
      measurements are stored in RAM. Since the AirBeam2 records 300 data points
      a minute when operating in mobile mode, this adds up fast. The more RAM
      your Android device has, the longer it will be able to record a mobile
      AirCasting session before filling up and crashing the app. (Don’t worry if
      this happens, your data will be saved before the app crashes.)  Beyond
      suggesting Android devices with sufficient RAM, we also recommend buying
      Android devices that cost $100 or more because you get what you pay for.
      The price of an Android device is frequently a better indicator of
      compatibility with the AirCasting app than the hardware and software
      specifications alone because more expensive Android devices are generally
      better built. If you plan to buy multiple Android devices, buy one device
      and test thoroughly with the AirCasting app before buying multiples.

    question: How much data is consumed when sending AirBeam2 data over cellular?
  - answer: >-
      When powered and running 24/7, the AirBeam consumes less than a nickel’s
      worth of electricity in a month.
