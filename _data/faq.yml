      AirBeam2 is “quite accurate” according to the performance evaluation
      conducted by South Coast Air Quality Management District’s AQ-SPEC lab.
      Another AirBeam2 performance evaluation, conducted by researchers at NYU
      School of Medicine, also found that the PM2.5 measurements from the
      AirBeam2 closely matched those from a collocated reference instrument.
