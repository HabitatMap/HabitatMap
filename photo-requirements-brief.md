# Photo Requirements Brief for HabitatMap AirBeam Project

## Overview

We need high-quality photographs featuring real people using AirBeam air quality monitors to enhance our website's visual storytelling and user engagement.

## Technical Specifications

### Image Quality & Resolution

- **Minimum Resolution**: 300 DPI for print quality
- **File Format**: High-resolution JPEG or PNG
- **Color Profile**: sRGB color space preferred
- **File Size**: Uncompressed/minimally compressed for maximum quality

### Dimensions & Orientation

- **Primary Requirement**: Horizontal (landscape) orientation
- **Hero Section Images**: Exact dimensions of **2000 × 740 pixels**
- **General Images**: Minimum width of 1920px for web responsiveness
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 or similar wide format preferred

## Content Requirements

### Subject Matter

- **Real People**: Authentic users (not stock models) interacting with AirBeam devices
- **Action Shots**: People actively using the AirBeam in real-world scenarios:
  - Walking/jogging with AirBeam while monitoring air quality
  - Using AirBeam in urban environments
  - Community members checking air quality readings
  - Researchers or citizens taking measurements outdoors
  - People reviewing data on the AirCasting app

### Environment & Settings

- **Outdoor Locations**: Urban streets, parks, neighborhoods
- **Natural Lighting**: Avoid heavily staged or artificial lighting
- **Contextual Backgrounds**: Show relevant environments where air quality monitoring matters
- **Diverse Settings**: Various locations that represent different use cases

### Style Guidelines

- **Authentic & Documentary Style**: Candid, real-world usage
- **Good Lighting**: Well-lit subjects with clear visibility of the AirBeam device
- **Uncluttered Composition**: Clean backgrounds that don't distract from the main subject
- **Positive Tone**: Images should convey empowerment and environmental awareness

## Specific Shot Types Needed

### Hero Section (Priority)

- **Dimensions**: 2000 × 740 pixels exactly
- **Subject**: Person actively using AirBeam with clear product visibility
- **Composition**: **Subject must NOT be centered** - position person/AirBeam to left or right third of frame to allow for text overlay
- **Text Overlay Space**: Leave clear, uncluttered space on opposite side for website text and call-to-action elements
- **Quality**: Highest resolution and sharpest focus

### Supporting Images

- Close-up shots of hands holding AirBeam device
- Wide shots showing environmental context
- Multiple people using AirBeam in community settings
- Before/after scenarios (polluted vs. clean air environments)

## Delivery Requirements

- **File Naming**: Descriptive filenames (e.g., "person-walking-airbeam-urban-street.jpg")
- **Multiple Formats**: Original high-res + web-optimized versions
- **Rights & Permissions**: All necessary model releases and usage rights included
- **Timeline**: [Insert deadline here]

## Questions for Discussion

1. Do you have access to real AirBeam users for authentic photography?
2. Are there specific demographic groups or communities you'd like represented?
3. What geographic locations would be most relevant?
4. Do you need photos showing both AirBeam3 and AirBeam Mini devices?
