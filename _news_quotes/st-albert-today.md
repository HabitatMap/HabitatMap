  Cheap portable sensors like the AirBeam could help focus efforts to track air
  quality. If a group were to make a bunch of them available to borrow, parents
  could wear them while biking or driving around town, and students could use
  them to track emissions from cars idling at their schools. Eventually, a map
  could be compiled of pollution hot spots in the city, showing where the
  problems are and the possible causes of them.
