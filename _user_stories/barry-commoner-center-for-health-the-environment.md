<p>The Barry Commoner Center for Health and the Environment (BCCHE) is an environmental and occupational health research institute at Queens College, City University of New York. The mission of the Center is to identify and rectify environmental and occupational threats to human health. BCCHE, in partnership with DOHMH, sought to understand how academic institutions, city governments, and community groups can work together to increase air quality monitoring within communities using citizen-collected data and to enable communities to understand air pollution and its sources.</p>
<p>As a follow-up study from the New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS) project, the objectives behind this citizen science project were not just to address the gaps and concerns associated with institutional monitoring, but also to raise awareness of air quality on a community level. It focused on improving community-level engagement through direct public interaction and emphasized the importance of collaboration and establishing the best practices for a scientific study when conducting a citizen science project. This was only possible with the direct involvement of the communities that are impacted by the existing environmental challenges in the areas studied.</p>
<p>In collaboration with two community-based organizations, El Puente de Williamsburg and YMPJ the Bronx, BCCHE created a pilot community-based air quality monitoring network, whereby community members and project partners designed and implemented a stationary network to collect and share local air quality data using AirBeam2 monitors. Utilizing the information collected through citizen science in conjunction with current city-wide air quality monitoring efforts, this partnership created a richer picture of neighborhood-level variation in air quality and thus provided communities with a better understanding of the air quality in their neighborhood. The community was involved in all aspects of the study, ranging from project design to implementation. Members of the community and high school students participated in both defining the study objectives and the collection of air quality data using low-cost sensor technology (AirBeam2) based on personal monitoring procedures. Key targets for the data collection on PM<sub>2.5 </sub>exposure included schools and playgrounds near major roadways. Project participants attended workshops and training sessions to better understand air pollution in their community and to learn how to use low-cost sensor technology (AirBeam2) to collect and analyze environmental data. BCCHE provided expertise in the review, analysis, and summaries of the data collected by the El Puente and YMPJ communities.</p>
<p>Understanding the spatial and temporal scales at which air quality affects people is critical for maintaining the overall health of a community. Due to the high cost and technical requirements associated with regulatory-grade instrumentation like the Federal Reference Method (FRM) and Federal Equivalent Method (FEM), multiple challenges were encountered during installation at multiple locations. This work intended to explore the feasibility of using low-cost instrumentation to create a more accessible platform for measuring air quality. Based on the trade-off analysis for accuracy and cost, low-cost monitors have proven to be a good alternative for measuring air pollutant concentrations. Besides, the collaboration with NYSDEC and having access to the DEC monitoring locations were invaluable during the design and testing phase of the low-cost air quality monitoring units (Housing unit + AirBeam2 + cellular data acquisition system). The result was a prototype for a low-cost air quality monitoring system named &lsquo;Air Quality Monitor&rsquo; (AQM). The low-cost AQM provided the opportunity of many devices being installed at multiple locations to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of monitoring or surveillance areas. AirBeam2 illustrated the advantage of low-cost monitor platforms by helping drive down the cost of data acquisition and providing more insights into the air quality network. Due to higher spatial resolution, a more comprehensive analysis of urban environments was made possible through the proposed monitoring system.</p>
