<p>Via a community science project, BCCHE, in partnership with the New York City Dept of Health & Mental Hygiene, sought to understand how academic institutions, city governments, and community groups can work together to increase air quality monitoring within communities using citizen-collected data and enable communities to understand air pollution and its sources.</p>


<p>As a follow-on to the annual<a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/data/data-publications/air-quality-nyc-community-air-survey.page">New York City Community Air Survey</a>, the objectives behind the community science project were to both address gaps and concerns associated with institutional monitoring, and raise awareness around air quality issues. The project focused on improving community engagement through direct public interaction and emphasized the importance of collaboration and establishing best practices for a scientific study when conducting a community science project. This was only possible with the direct involvement of the communities impacted by existing air pollution sources.</p>


<p>BCCHE, In collaboration with two community-based organizations, <a href="https://elpuente.us/">El Puente de Williamsburg</a> and <a href="https://www.ympj.org/">Youth Ministries for Peace & Justice</a>, created a pilot community-based air quality monitoring network, whereby community members and project partners designed and implemented a stationary network to collect and share hyperlocal air quality data using AirBeam2s. Utilizing the data from the AirBeam2s in conjunction with current city-wide air quality monitoring efforts, this partnership created a richer picture of neighborhood-level variation in air quality and provided communities with a better understanding of the air quality in their neighborhood.</p> 

<p>The community was involved in all aspects of the study, ranging from project design to implementation. Members of the community and high school students participated in both defining the study objectives and collecting the air quality data. Key locations for data collection on PM2.5 exposures included schools and playgrounds along the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. Project participants attended workshops and training sessions to better understand air pollution in their community and learn how to use AirBeam2 to collect and analyze environmental data. BCCHE provided expertise in the review, analysis, and summary of the data collected by El Puente de Williamsburg and Youth Ministries for Peace & Justice communities.</p>
