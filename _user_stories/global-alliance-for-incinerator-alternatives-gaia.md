Across communities in Nigeria, the Philippines, and Indonesia, residents living near incinerators often described the same grim reality: thick smoke in the air, a sharp chemical smell, and a constant feeling of being ignored. But without concrete data, their complaints were too often dismissed.

To change that, the [Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives](https://www.no-burn.org/) (GAIA) launched [Clearing the Air](https://www.no-burn.org/clearingtheair/) – a community science initiative that equips frontline communities with AirBeam monitors to collect real-time air quality data. Designed to expose the dangers of incinerators and strengthen community-led advocacy, the project was born out of frustration with government inaction and a desire to engage residents in community science. 

In many of these regions, especially in working-class neighborhoods home to women and children, the health harms of incineration have long gone unaddressed. Government air monitoring, where it exists at all, often paints a sanitized picture. GAIA set out to empower local residents most affected by toxic emissions to take air monitoring into their own hands.

After researching a number of tools, GAIA chose the AirBeam and AirCasting platform due to its accuracy, transparency, and ease of use - plus the responsive support from the HabitatMap team. The organization distributed monitors to volunteers near active incinerators, translating the data into local languages and pairing it with powerful visuals of pollution to tell a story that couldn’t be ignored.

Data painted an alarming picture: air quality near incinerators was far worse than WHO guidelines, with particulate matter concentrations exceeding WHO limits by up to eight times. The impact of having access to this data was immediate. In the Philippines, residents described a renewed sense of hope. Many had been documenting pollution through grassroots efforts, but now had data to back up their concerns and lay the groundwork for their demands.

In the Philippines, real-time data collected with the AirBeam helped provide clear, local evidence of air quality concerns around a pyrolysis plant in Dumaguete. Shortly after the release of the monitoring report, which was accompanied by multiple local launch events and strong media coverage, the mayor announced [the suspension of the facility](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gaia-global-alliance_shutdowndumaguetepyrolysis-clearingtheair-activity-7354400633724002304-KxQV/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADlr9s4Bbi1apdEKOxNDM_JGxWXx4eOM1GU), citing health concerns. These findings were also shared with the local city council, elevating the voices of residents with credible, science-backed research. After years of resisting the plant, community members were finally able to back up their concerns with real data from the AirBeam – turning lived experience into evidence that made a profound impact. 

In Nigeria, communities are actively using the data to engage government officials, who are now considering moving incinerator facilities elsewhere. In Indonesia, the government has finally become responsive to civil society voices due to the impact of the data, even making public pronouncements in the media. Before this project, all communications and requests were met with silence. The air quality data and initiatives from residents has now forced public officials to listen to residents’ concerns. 

Beyond these three countries, the ripple effect has already begun. GAIA has shared its methods across its global network, and interest is growing in replicating the project elsewhere. 

By combining clear data with community voices and visual evidence, Clearing the Air is proving that science doesn’t belong only in labs, it belongs in the hands of the people.
