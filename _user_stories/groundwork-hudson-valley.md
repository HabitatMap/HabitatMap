[Groundwork Hudson Valley](https://www.groundworkhv.org/programs/community-adaptation/air-quality/) is using the AirBeam not just to measure air pollution but to turn data into action. In Southwest Yonkers—an area burdened by limited green space, excessive paved surfaces, and high levels of traffic and industrial activity—residents face significant air quality challenges. These environmental stressors contribute to elevated temperatures and increased pollution, affecting both public health and the local ecosystem. In response, Groundwork is equipping the community with the tools and knowledge to understand what's in the air they breathe. Through workshops, educational materials, and grassroots campaigns they’re breaking down a complex issue and demonstrating the power of community science to drive change.

In the summer of 2024, Groundwork Hudson Valley launched Yonkers’ first-ever air quality monitoring program, marking a major step forward in local environmental justice. The initiative is driven by a dedicated working group that centers its efforts on four key areas: empowerment and education, data collection and analysis, community engagement, and data interpretation for action. Together, these pillars ensure that residents not only understand common air pollutants and how to interpret the Air Quality Index, but also feel empowered to use the data they collect to advocate for healthier, more informed communities.

For the first time, residents could borrow AirBeam devices and track air quality in the places that mattered most to them: outside of ice cream trucks, near school buses, along busy roads, and even on their daily commutes. The results were eye opening; people began to see that air pollution isn’t an abstract problem. It’s personal, and it’s right where they live, work, and spend their free time. The program has become a powerful tool for raising awareness about air quality and empowering community members to take control of their health; proving you don’t need to be a scientist to collect meaningful data and drive change.

Groundwork Hudson Valley’s program gives residents more than data, it gives them agency. By choosing where monitoring happens and how findings are shared, community members have a direct role in shaping the conversation around clean air. With partnership from the Yonkers Public Library, residents can borrow AirBeams through the Library of Things program. These efforts are helping reach even more neighbors and inspiring a wave of community engagement. 

Their work is making an impact. Now, community members are more vigilant about the pollution caused by cars and airplanes, and some local politicians have even included information about air quality monitoring in their newsletters. In one case, a community member shared air quality data she gathered from nearby school buses to engage her local school board. 

Groundwork Hudson Valley’s program proves that with access to the right tools, anyone can advocate for their community. The AirBeam makes it possible for residents to measure air pollution, collect scientific data, and advocate for healthier neighborhoods.
