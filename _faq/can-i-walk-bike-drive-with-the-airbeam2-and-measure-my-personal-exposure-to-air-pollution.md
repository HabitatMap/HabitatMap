question: >-
  Can I walk/bike/drive with the AirBeam2 and measure my personal exposure to
  air pollution?
answer: >-
  Yes, the AirBeam2 is designed to go wherever you go, unless youâ€™re going
  underwater.  When cycling or driving, face the AirBeam2 intake and exhaust
  ports (the performations located between the wavy edges) away from your
  direction of travel to minimize wind interference.
