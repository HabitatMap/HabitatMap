question: >-
  Whatâ€™s the best way to monitor the air quality in my home/workplace/school to
  determine when I should keep the windows closed or open them up to improve the
  air quality?
answer: >-
  Buy two AirBeam2s, configure them both to record fixed sessions, and place one
  inside and the other outside.  Keep tabs on the particulate matter
  measurements in real-time using the AirCasting app or website.  When the air
  quality is better outside than inside, open your windows.  When the air
  quality is better inside than outside, keep your windows closed.
