question: One more Gaiman plz
answer: >-
  Miss Spink and Miss Forcible lived in the flat below Coralineâ€™s, on the ground
  floor. They were both old and round, and they lived in their flat with a
  number of ageing highland terriers who had names like Hamish and Andrew and
  Jock. Once upon a time Miss Spink and Miss Forcible had been actresses, as
  Miss Spink told Coraline the first time she met her.
