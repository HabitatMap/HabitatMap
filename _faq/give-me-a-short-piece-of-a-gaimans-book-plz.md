question: Give me a short piece of a Gaiman's book plz
answer: >-
  Shadow had done three years in prison. He was big enough and looked
  don't-fuck-with-me enough that his biggest problem was killing time. So he
  kept himself in shape, and taught himself coin tricks, and thought a lot about
  how much he loved his wife.  The best thing - in Shadow's opinion, perhaps the
  only good thing - about being in prison was a feeling of relief. The feeling
  that he'd plunged as low as he could plunge and he'd hit bottom. He didn't
  worry that the man was going to get hurt, because the man had got him. He was
  no longer scared of what tomorrow might bring, because yesterday had brought
  it.
