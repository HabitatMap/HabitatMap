  The AirBeams were an incredibly powerful and important asset to our
  environmental exploration. It allowed for tangible, hands-on, real-time data
  collection - this directly influenced participants to engage with subjects
  such as public health and urban environmentalism. Being able to see how a
  truck passing by impacts our air inspires folks to advocate for themselves and
  their community - as well as sparking interest and curiosity into how these
  technologies work from a back-end perspective.
