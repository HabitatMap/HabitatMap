  The AirBeam is a <strong>low-cost and very accessible way</strong> to put hyperlocal air
  quality data in the hands of <strong>community members who need it the most</strong>, who are
  most affected by poor air quality, and who can use it as a starting point to
  understand personal exposures to air pollution.
