          From Brooklyn Neighbors to Global Movement

            In 2006, Brooklyn neighbors worried about their families' health near the polluted Newtown Creek. They
            could see and smell contamination but lacked data to prove its impact, so they started HabitatMap.

            Since then, the initiative has helped communities across the globe fight environmental injustice by
            providing accessible tools and expertise.
