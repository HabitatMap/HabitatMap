          In 2006, Brooklyn neighbors worried about their families' health near the polluted Newtown Creek. They
          could see and smell contamination but lacked data to prove its impact, so they started HabitatMap.
        </p>
        <p class="donate-story-origin-impact">
          Since then, the initiative has helped communities across the globe fight environmental injustice by
          providing accessible tools and expertise.
