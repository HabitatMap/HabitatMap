<p>Most sound level meters come equipped with a foam windscreen that fits over the top of the microphone, protecting it from wind interference. If you plan to use your phone mic for recording sound level readings, try crafting a windscreen to increase the accuracy of your readings.  I improvised a homemade windscreen by taking the foam covers off an old pair of headphones, rolling them up together, and jamming them between the phone mic and my plastic phone case. I "tested" the setup by holding my phone in front of a fan and the windshield proved effective, dropping around 10 decibels (dB) of wind interference. In comparison, the windscreens on my sound level meters were able to drop around 15 - 20 dB.  If you come up with a better method of protecting your phone mic from wind interference please email us at info@habitatmap.org.</p>
