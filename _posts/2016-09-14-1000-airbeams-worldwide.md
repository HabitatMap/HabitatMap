<p>With over 1,000 <a title="AirBeams" href="http://www.takingspace.org/aircasting/airbeam/" target="_blank">AirBeams</a> in use worldwide and more than 100 million data points, the <a title="AirCasting Platform" href="http://aircasting.org/" target="_blank">AirCasting platform</a> is now one of the largest open-source databases of community-collected air quality measurements ever created. Community based organizations, educators, academics, regulators, and citizen scientists around the world use the AirBeam to measure, map, stream, and crowdsource PM2.5 measurements. The collective effort of thousands of individual AirCasters made this historic milestone possible. Are you curious about who these folks are and where they come from? To give an idea of how diverse our worldwide community is, we’ve posted some of their organizational affiliations below.</p>
