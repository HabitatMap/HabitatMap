<p>I recorded an AirCasting session yesterday that highlights the contrasts between the Gowanus and Park Slope neighborhoods. Though the neighborhoods are close geographically speaking, the streetscapes are very different from one another as are the noise levels. To contextualize the sound level readings (and to show off one of our latest features) I attached notes and photos to my AirCasting session. Have a look: "<a href="http://aircasting.org/s/gnhc8" target="_blank">Gowanus Canal to Prospect Park</a>".</p>
