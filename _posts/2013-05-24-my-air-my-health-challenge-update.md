<p>We submitted our solution to the <a href="http://challenge.gov/HHS/372-my-air-my-health-challenge" target="_blank">My Air, My Health Challenge</a> judges a few weeks back. We won't know who won until they make the official announcement at the <a href="http://healthdatapalooza.org/" target="_blank">Health Datapalooza IV</a>. In  the meantime, we thought we'd share our solution (<a href="http://www.takingspace.org/wp-content/uploads/MAMHSolutionNarrative-HabitatMap+NYU+CMU.pdf" target="_blank">which can be downloaded as a PDF here</a>) along with the instructional video we created  to introduce our pilot community health study participants to the AirCasting platform. Let us know what you think. Any and all feedback is appreciated.</p>
