<p>We're happy to announce an update to the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.llp.aircasting&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">AirCasting app</a> that includes connectivity for the Zephyr BioHarness 3. The BioHarness connects to the AirCasting app over Bluetooth, enabling AirCasters to record heart rate, heart rate variability, R to R interval, activity level, peak acceleration, breathing rate, and core temperature measurements. You can download the update from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.llp.aircasting&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a>.</p>
