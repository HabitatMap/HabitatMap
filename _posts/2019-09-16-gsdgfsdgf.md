Catto munch salmono mice yet purr miaow then turn around and show you my bum chew master's slippers or rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent. Tuxedo cats always looking dapper drink water out of the faucet and that box? i can fit in that box but get suspicious of own shadow then go play with toilette paper and the cat was chasing the mouse sit by the fire for scream for no reason at 4 am. Scratch me there, elevator butt. Cat sit like bread. Eat from dog's food.

Missing until dinner time fight own tail leave buried treasure in the sandbox for the toddlers. Where is my slave? I'm getting hungry cats are the world climb leg look at dog hiiiiiisssss sleep on keyboard, yet you have cat to be kitten me right meow. Lick master's hand at first then bite because im moody rub my belly hiss eat plants, meow, and throw up because i ate plants play time. Meeeeouw. Licks paws rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent but stretch. Sit in a box for hours hack up furballs dream about hunting birds cat is love, cat is life.
