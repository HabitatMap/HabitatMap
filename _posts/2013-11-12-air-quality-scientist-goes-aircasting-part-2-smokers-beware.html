<p>Last week, <a href="http://www.takingspace.org/air-quality-scientist-goes-aircasting-part-1/">I wrote about Aircasting with my Car-Neph</a>. This week, I want to tell you about my Backpack-Neph.</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="600" caption="The Backpack-Neph"]<img style="text-decoration: underline;" title="The Backpack-Neph" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/BackpackNeph.jpg" alt="The Backpack-Neph" width="600" height="436" />[/caption]</p>
<p>The below image provides an overhead view of the <a href="http://www.pscleanair.org/" target="_blank">Puget Sound Clean Air Agency's</a> office building in downtown Seattle with my <a href="http://aircasting.org/map#/map_sessions?data={%22location%22:{%22address%22:%22%22,%22distance%22:%2210%22,%22limit%22:false},%22gridResolution%22:25,%22tags%22:%22%22,%22usernames%22:%22harpernavy1@gmail,%20%22,%22time%22:{%22timeFrom%22:300,%22timeTo%22:1739,%22dayFrom%22:0,%22dayTo%22:365,%22yearFrom%22:2011,%22yearTo%22:2013},%22heat%22:{%22highest%22:100,%22high%22:70,%22mid%22:50,%22low%22:30,%22lowest%22:0},%22sensorId%22:%22%22}&amp;sessionsIds=[2642]&amp;tmp={%22tmpSensorId%22:%22Light%20Scatter-M903%22}&amp;map={%22zoom%22:18,%22lat%22:47.61150987877286,%22lng%22:-122.33840915562905,%22mapType%22:%22hybrid%22}" target="_blank">AirCasting tracks and graph overlaid</a>. The day was blustery and cool, so there was little background air pollution outside (Green Air Quality Index). I turned on my Backpack-Neph, collected some indoor air, and then headed outside to the bus stop. There weren't many people there at the time but there were two buses. I brought my Backpack-Neph over to where the buses were and sampled some of that air. The first spike into the yellow on the graph is the bus exhaust. Next, I walked around the city some more before returning to the bus stop. When I showed up again there were several people smoking cigarettes next to two buses. The second spike, which reaches into the red, illustrates the impact the smokers were having on the air I was breathing. Yuck! Smokers beware, I'll be watching you withÂ  my Backpack-Neph!</p>

<p>Part of my job, and one of my passions, is communicating the complexities of air quality science in ways that are accessible to the public.
