<p>We’re excited to announce the release of the <a title="How To Build An AirCasting Air Monitor" href="http://www.habitatmap.org/habitatmap_docs/HowToBuildAnAirCastingAirMonitor.pdf" target="_blank">step-by-step instruction manual for the AirCasting Air Monitor</a>. This handy guide has all the information you need to build your very own mobile air quality monitor and connect it to the AirCasting app to map and graph your sensor measurements in real-time. The Arduino-powered AirCasting Air Monitor senses temperature, humidity, carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) gas concentrations.  Note that if you’re interested in measuring different parameters, it’s simple to modify the design to incorporate new sensors.</p>
