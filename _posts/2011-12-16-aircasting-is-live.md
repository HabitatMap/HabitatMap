<p>We released the <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=pl.llp.aircasting" target="_blank">AirCasting app</a> to the Android Market late last night and the <a href="http://aircasting.org/" target="_blank">AirCasting website</a> went live today!Â  After spending the weekend testing and contributing data to the CrowdMap, we'll officially launch AirCasting this Tuesday, 12/20.</p>
