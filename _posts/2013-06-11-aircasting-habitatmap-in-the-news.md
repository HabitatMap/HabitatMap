<p><a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/microsampling-air-pollution/" target="_blank"><em>The New York Times</em></a> followed us around while we went AirCasting, then wrote a story and made a video about it. The story is excellent in that it covers not only AirCasting but a range of different citizen science air quality monitoring efforts. We also landed an article in <a href="http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/06/10/air-quality-app" target="_blank"><em>Take Part</em></a> that provides a nice overview of how HabitatMap got started and where we're headed with AirCasting. And for the techies out there, have a look at the AirCasting coverage from the <a href="http://blog.arduino.cc/2013/05/09/diy-air-quality-sensing-from-habitatmap-and-sonoma-tech/" target="_blank"><em>Arduino Blog</em></a>.</p>
