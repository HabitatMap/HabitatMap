<p>We've just released the <a href="https://content.instructables.com/FUH/F976/HAQ3BZA9/FUHF976HAQ3BZA9.pdf" target="_blank">step-by-step instruction manual detailing how to make your own AirCasting luminescent apparel</a>. AirCasting Luminescence uses a IOIO microcontroller to convert your AirBeam's particulate matter measurements into a fashion statement. The more particulate matter in the air, the brighter your apparel glows. <a href="https://content.instructables.com/FUH/F976/HAQ3BZA9/FUHF976HAQ3BZA9.pdf" target="_blank">download the AirCasting Luminescence DIY guide</a> and make a fashion statement with your sensor measurements!</p>
