<p>We've just released the <a href="http://www.habitatmap.org/habitatmap_docs/MakeYourOwnAirCastingLuminescentApparel.pdf" target="_blank">step-by-step instruction manual detailing how to make your own AirCasting luminescent apparel</a>. AirCasting Luminescence uses a IOIO microcontroller connected to the AirCasting app over Bluetooth to illuminate LEDs in response to the sensor measurements received by the AirCasting app: green for low intensity, then yellow, then orange, and red for high intensity. AirCasting Luminescence was developed to communicate sensor measurements without the normally required reference to a screen interface and to spark interaction between AirCasters and people located in their immediate vicinity. So go ahead, <a href="http://www.habitatmap.org/habitatmap_docs/MakeYourOwnAirCastingLuminescentApparel.pdf" target="_blank">download the AirCasting Luminescence DIY guide</a> and make a fashion statement with your sensor measurements!</p>
