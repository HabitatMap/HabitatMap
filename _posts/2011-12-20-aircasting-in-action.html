<p>After taking time this weekend and yesterday to do more testing, we officially launched AirCasting today.  Below I've described a couple of my recent sessions to illustrate AirCasting in action.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aircasting.org/s/27d3r" target="_blank">Times Square to Central Park (click to view map)</a><br />
What better way to start AirCasting then navigating between two New York City landmarks. As one would expect, the hustle and bustle of noisy Times Square slowly receded as I made my way up 7th Ave from 42nd St. (You can also see that the GPS had a difficult time locating me amongst all the skyscrapers.) Noise levels peaked again waiting to cross 57th Street’s four lanes of traffic. And living up to its reputation as a respite for a busy city, noise levels dropped almost immediately upon entering Central Park.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aircasting.org/s/33b6a">East Williamsburg Truck Routes (click to view map)</a><br />
This part of East Williamsburg is plagued by a seemingly endless procession of trucks making their way up and down Grand St., Metropolitan Ave., and Vandervoort Ave. According to a recent <a href="http://www.newtowncreekalliance.org/docs/OUTRAGE_TruckTraffic&amp;AirQualityReportSummary.pdf" target="_blank">Truck Study</a> conducted by Organizations United for Trash Reduction and Equity, half these trucks are carrying waste. Not a surprise when you know this area handles nearly 40% of the 12 million plus tons of waste moving through <a href="http://www.newtowncreekalliance.org/waste-transfer-stations/" target="_blank">waste transfer stations in New York City</a> annually. Noise levels spiked as convoys of trucks made their way between stoplights. The loudest area was the Metropolitan Ave. Bridge, where the traffic from both Metropolitan and Grand merge. I ended my AirCasting session with a little peace and quiet as I crossed through the Williamsburg Houses.</p>
