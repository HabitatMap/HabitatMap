  <p class="p--body">
    When recording a mobile session with AirBeam3, you can separate AirBeam3 from your Android or iOS device and continue recording, geolocating, and timestamping your measurements. To do this, tap the three horizontal dots located in the upper right hand corner of the session card, map, or graph and tap “Enter standalone mode”. After entering standalone mode, the connection indicator will blink yellow when you don’t have a GPS fix and blink orange when you do have a GPS fix. When you don’t have a GPS fix, your measurements will be pinned to your last know location. To get a GPS fix, move outside to a location with a clear view of the sky. In some instances, it can take 5-10 minutes before AirBeam3 gets a GPS fix. <em>Note that an iPhone 8 or higher or an Android 8 or higher plus Bluetooth 5 device is required to utilize the Standalone Mode and Sync SD Card features.</em>

    Sync SD Card
  </h2>

  <p class="p--body">
    Whenever your AirBeam3 is recording a mobile or fixed session, it will log data to its SD card. In instances where your AirBeam is connected to the app via Bluetooth (mobile sessions) or sending data via either the WiFi or cellular network directly to the AirCasting server (fixed sessions), the data on the SD card duplicates the data already submitted to and saved in the AirCasting database. However, if when recording a mobile session you enter standalone mode, or when recording a fixed session AirBeam3's cellular or WiFi connection is interrupted, you can sync AirBeam3's SD card to retrieve your data. To do this either a) tap the “finish recording & sync” button on your mobile session card; or b) tap the “+” button at the bottom of the screen then tap “Sync data from AirBeam3” and follow the on screen instructions. After syncing the session data from your SD card to the AirCasting database, the SD card will be deleted. <em>Note that an iPhone 8 or higher or an Android 8 or higher plus Bluetooth 5 device is required to utilize the Standalone Mode and Sync SD Card features.</em>

    AirBeam3 Performance Data
  </h2>

  <p class="p--body">
    AirBeam3 is the most accurate and versatile portable air quality monitor on the market. Of the 75 PM2.5 measuring instruments evaluated by the <a href="http://www.aqmd.gov/aq-spec/sensordetail/habitatmap---airbeam3">SCAQMD AQ-SPEC program</a>, AirBeam3 is the most accurate when both the field and lab evaluations are considered. 
  </p>

    <p class="p--body">
    To create AirBeam3 calibration equations for PM1 and PM2.5 we used the <a href="http://www.aqmd.gov/aq-spec/sensordetail/habitatmap-airbeam2">laboratory test results from the AirBeam2’s AQ-SPEC evaluation</a>, wherein AirBeam2 measurements were compared to measurements from a GRIMM Federal Equivalency Method instrument. Both AirBeam2 and AirBeam3 utilize the same particulate matter sensor: the Plantower PMS7003
  </p>

  <p class="p--body">
    To develop AirBeam3 calibration equation for PM1, we first reverted the AirBeam2s PM1 calibrations to get back to the sensor manufacturer’s default “ambient” PM1 measurements. Next, we fit the AirBeam2s default PM1 measurements against the GRIMM PM1 values by fitting a piecewise linear regression model at breakpoints (identified using ‘segmented’ package in R) to generate AirBeam3 PM1 calibration equation. After doing this, the newly fitted AirBeam2 PM1 values show highly linear agreement with GRIMM PM1 values; see below figures illustrating the fit before and after. (Note, in the figures below, the red line is the piecewise regression, and the dotted black lines depict a line with slope=1.)
  </p>

  <p class="p--body">
    Next, we fit the newly calibrated PM1 measurements from AirBeam2 against the GRIMM PM2.5 measurements (again using a piecewise linear regression model) to generate AirBeam3 PM2.5 calibration equation. We used the newly fit AirBeam2 PM1 calibration to fit the PM2.5 model since it performed better than using the AirBeam2 PM2.5 measurements. The newly fitted AirBeam2 PM2.5 values show highly linear agreement with GRIMM PM2.5 values; see below figures illustrating the fit before and after.

    alt="NYUSOM CAPS"
  />

  <p class="p--body">
    Finally, since AirBeam2 PM10 measurements did not show good agreement with the GRIMM PM10 measurements gathered during the lab test, we instead fit a piecewise regression against the BAM Federal Equivalency Method instrument it was collocated with during <a href="http://www.aqmd.gov/aq-spec/sensordetail/habitatmap-airbeam2">South Coast Air Quality Management District’s field evaluation of the AirBeam2</a>. However, after the calibration the agreement was still relatively poor, suggesting that AirBeam3 PM10 measurements are much less accurate than desired.
  </p>

  <p class="p--body">
    It should be noted that AirBeam3 calibration equations do not account for relative humidity. Prior academic research indicates high relative humidity can significantly impact the measurements from light scattering sensors. Also, given the geographic and seasonal variation in aerosols around the world and the variable response of light scattering sensors to differing aerosol compositions, AirBeam3 measurements will be more accurate in some settings than others.
  </p>

  <p class="p--body">
    We look forward to learning more about AirBeam3 performance as additional evaluations are performed. Please contact us if you undertake an evaluation of AirBeam3 and generate data that can be publicly shared as we would be happy to disseminate your findings via the AirCasting network.
  </p>

  <p class="p--body">
    <em>AirBeam3 calibration equations were developed by <a href="https://www.publichealth.arizona.edu/directory/chris-lim">Chris C. Lim</a>, an assistant professor in the Department of Community, Environment, and Policy at the University of Arizona.</em>
