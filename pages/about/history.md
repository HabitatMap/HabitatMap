    HabitatMap was launched in 2006 by Brooklyn activists with a shared interest in developing technology to support community organizing efforts directed at cleaning up Newtown Creek and addressing health concerns in the surrounding Brooklyn and Queens neighborhoods. Responding to the needs of the Newtown Creek Alliance, HabitatMap worked with the community to map hazardous facilities, contaminated properties, and potential access points as a way of raising the Creek’s profile and influencing public agencies and legislators to act on the community’s behalf. This work helped catalyze ongoing federal and state remediation efforts that are mitigating health hazards in the surrounding residential neighborhoods while cleaning up Newtown Creek and expanding public access to the waterway.

    Encouraged by the positive impact community mapping had, HabitatMap - led by community activist and information designer Michael Heimbinder - expanded its technology platform and in 2011 launched AirCasting: an open-source environmental data visualization platform that consists of an Android app and online mapping system. Later in 2015, HabitatMap rolled out a palm-sized companion air quality instrument called the AirBeam. AirBeam2, HabitatMap’s second version of the product, shipped in mid-2018. This low-cost tool measures hyperlocal concentrations of harmful microscopic particles in the air, known as particulate matter, and in conjunction with the free to use AirCasting platform, helps community-based organizations, educators, academics, regulators, city managers, and citizen scientists map air pollution and organize for clean air.

    Today, with thousands of AirBeams in use worldwide, the AirCasting platform is one of the largest open-source databases of community-collected air quality measurements ever created.
