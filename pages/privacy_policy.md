    HabitatMap will never use any personal or sensitive information to market to you or pass your information to any third party.
  </p>

  <p class="p--body">
   HabitatMap’s AirCasting app and AirCasting website neither request any personally identifiable information nor require any personally identifiable information. Before using the AirCasting app, you must create a profile name and provide an email address. Neither your profile name nor email address need to include information that identifies you personally. In addition, we do not verify email addresses, so the email address provided need not be valid. Though it should be noted, an invalid email address will prevent you from recovering your account in the event you forget your password.
  </p>
  
  <p class="p--body">
  Both the AirCasting app and the AirCasting and HabitatMap websites are compliant with the EU General Data Protection Regulation. Specifically, we recognize that users have the following rights: a right to portability of your personal data; a right to obtain restriction of your personal data’s processing; a right to obtain erasure of your personal data; and a right not to be subject to an automated individual decision.
 </p>
  
  <p class="p--body">
   Location: The AirCasting app collects location data to enable geolocation of your health and environmental monitoring measurements. When recording a mobile session, the app will track your location even when the app is closed or not in use. The AirCasting app has several features that enable location data to remain private. AirCasters can “disable maps” in the app settings, which turns off GPS tracking. When AirCasters record data with the GPS disabled, the data never leaves the Android device and is never synced to our servers. AirCasters can elect to save their data to the AirCasting server but not contribute it to the “CrowdMap”. This means the data can only be viewed on the website via a link that you generate inside the app when signed in. AirCasters can also elect to send the data from the app directly to their own server, entirely bypassing the AirCasting server. In addition, when recording fixed indoor sessions, GPS coordinates are never logged.

  <p class="p--body">
    Microphone: To record sound level measurements, the AirCasting app requests permission to access your microphone. The raw audio captured by AirCasters’ microphones is never recorded; rather the audio signal is immediately converted to a sound level measurement before it is stored on the phone and communicated to the AirCasting server.
  </p>

  <p class="p--body">
    Phone Status: To record sound level measurements, the AirCasting app requests permission to read your phone’s state. Knowing the state of an AirCaster’s phone allows the app to temporarily suspend the recording of sound level measurements during phone calls.
  </p>

  <p>
    USB Storage: To attach photos to notes, the AirCasting app requests permission to read the contents of your USB storage.
